You've reached the landing page for the _Less Data, Same Happiness_ project. This is an extension of the paper [Housing, Health & Happiness (2009)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.1.1.75). 

You can find the full analysis for this project by navigating to the [Datastory page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link datastory.md %}) If it takes a minute or two to load, no need to be alarmed, that's only because there are several interactive data visualizations.

For links to the Github repository for this project and author information, check out the sidebar on the left side of the page.
